They welcomed people into their home, played a huge role in the church, and always thought of others before themselves. From sponsoring children in third world countries, to cooking and serving at soup kitchens, to organizing gifts and holiday food for needy families, Barbara and Nick set an incredible example of lives well-lived. Their girls; Michele, Christine, Antonia and later Johannah learned the impact and importance of volunteerism, which would ignite a passion inside of them. The idea of doing good and helping others was eventually passed on to the next generation of nine grandchildren ranging in age from 13-25.`)
