            <p>
                Carolyn Daurio came in first place for the award, winning one thousand dollars. Carolyn has devoted an abundance of time to Refugee Assistance Partners New Jersey (RAP), 
                which is a 501 (c) (3) nonprofit that provides support for refugees beginning to resettle in or around Union County. RAP assists refugees with essential needs such as 
                housing, school, medical issues, and jobs. Carolyn has volunteered for RAP for the past seven years and has made a huge difference in the lives of various refugee families. 
                She has worked to help refugees from Congo, Sudan, and Afghanistan overcome a myriad of obstacles and gain self-sufficiency. Carolyn has also assisted in transportation 
                for RAP numerous times. "During the darkest days of the COVID pandemic, Carolyn was one of the faithful cadre of drivers delivering hot meals, paper products, and other 
                necessities to refugee families facing a sudden loss of income and isolation," says Lois Whitehead, Carolyn's nominator. Carolyn is now a member of the RAP Advisory Committee 
                and aids the organization in improving its ability to meet the needs of the refugee community. Carolyn is more than deserving of the Chasing Good Award as compensation 
                for all her hard work in helping society. More information about RAP can be found at <a href="http://www.refugeeassistancepartnersnj.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.refugeeassistancepartnersnj.org/</a>. 
                Congratulations Carolyn!

            </div>
            <p>
                <em>Chasing Good's</em> second place winner was Sandra (Sandy) Powers, who earned seven hundred and fifty dollars for her work with the National Alliance on Mental Illness 
                (NAMI) of Union County. Sandy created two special social events: the NAMI Holiday Star Party and the Summer Pizza Party, both of which were designed to bring joy to adults 
                in Union County with a mental health diagnosis. The December holiday party consisted of music, a sing-along, and gift bags with toiletries, clothing, and Sandy's homemade 
                cookies. This was the only holiday celebration that some participants experienced. The annual Summer Pizza Party provides gifts, prizes, pizza, soda, snacks, and more of Sandy's 
                famous cookies. Joann Mehalick, the 2022 first place winner and Sandy's nominator, describes her as having "humility, compassion, and nonstop energy that would rival the Energizer bunny”. 
                Chasing Good is happy to award the second place prize to Sandy: someone who, according to Joann, has been "chasing good for all of her life". More information about NAMI can be

            <p>
                The third place winner, earning five hundred dollars, was an organization called Imagine, a Center for Coping with Loss. In 2012, Imagine began offering grief support group to 
                families of all ages. Imagine provides opportunities for families who experienced a loss to meet with others on a biweekly basis. Imagine embraces people with open arms and centers 
                around the principle that those who grieve are not alone. In children, Imagine's services have proven to boost the grades, mental health, and coping skills of participants. Facilitators 
                who assist in grief counseling are not exempt from the benefits of Imagine's community. Some find it life-changing to know that they are helping people through the arguably most 
                difficult aspect of life. Furthermore, Imagine's grief education trains thousands of people in how to support someone who is going through any type of loss. Nominator Connie Palmer 
                urges society to "Imagine a world where we can talk openly about grief, get the support we need; a world where we will all be better off".  Imagine's tremendous work of restoring hope 
                has earned our third place Chasing Good Award! Executive Director Lindsay Schambach is a passionate presence at Imagine. As she wholeheartedly believes in its mission, she accepts this 
                award on Imagine's behalf. For more information on Imagine, a Center for Coping with Loss, visit <a href="http://imaginenj.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://imaginenj.org/</a>.

            </div>
            <p>
                Last but absolutely not least, the one hundred dollar Honorable Mention was awarded to Gianna Puglisi, a high school senior who was able to help many people by providing shopping carts 
                that assist people at food pantries transport the food home. When Gianna's St. Helen's Youth Group volunteered at St. Joseph Social Service Center in Elizabeth, she noticed that a large 
                portion of the people coming for food could not take everything offered because there was simply no way to carry it all. When Gianna made this observation, watermelons were given out and 
                she watched as many hungry people refused the heavy fruit. After a second trip to St. Joseph's, Gianna noticed this issue once again, and decided to ask the St. Helen's Youth Minister 
                about fundraising to provide shopping carts to the community serviced by the food pantry. Corey Wu-Jung, St. Joseph's employee and Gianna's nominator, said that Gianna "enlisted the help of 
                the [Westfield High School] Community Service Group to assist with raising funds", as well as the St. Helen's parish community. Gianna makes it clear that an abundance of good exists in 
                younger generations. Information on St. Josephs can be found at <a href="http://www.sjeliz.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.sjeliz.org</a> and also check out Gianna's narrated

            <p>First place, winning, $1000 is Joann Mehalick of Clark, nominated by her friend Bonnie Busler.
                Bonnie explains: that years ago, there were no local resources for her friend or her family, to
                take advantage of at that time to help with mental illness or to learn how the family could
                adjust. Joann discovered the existence of NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness;
                www.nami.org) There were no local chapters available. My friend and her family felt hopeless.
                Putting apprehension and fear aside, she dove in headfirst and created the current and only
                Union County chapter of NAMI and never looked back. In doing so, she was able to help
                hundreds of families navigate the much misunderstood mental illness dilemma for those with
                these diseases as well as their bewildered families. She initiated training programs and provided
                available resources. She initiated the family to family course in the county and taught it for 5
                years while providing instruction and materials for new volunteers to teach the program. She
                introduced police training education to deal with the mentally ill to help alleviate major
                confrontations and confusion for the mentally ill. She sought out and arranged for professionals
                to speak to families and those with mental illness. These programs are still being implemented
                throughout Union County. She has done this all on a volunteer basis for 30+ years! Joann’s
                determination and passion has been an inspiration to all who know her.
                Congratulations to Joann!

                Second place went to an organization- Mobile Meals of Westfield. They took home $750. Here is
                some information on the wonderful work they do.
                *They are a non-profit organization which provides nutritious and delicious prepared
                meals for those unable to provide meals for themselves.
                *Their mission is to serve our neighbors in need by preparing/delivering meals &amp;
                providing caring contact. Mobile Meals of Westfield is a voluntary, 501(c)3 non-profit program,
                and is available to residents of Clark, Cranford, Fanwood, Garwood, Mountainside, Scotch Plains,
                and Westfield New Jersey.
                
                *They have provided meals for those unable to prepare meals for themselves since
                1968.
                *In their first 50 years of operation, they have served over one million meals to the ill,
                elderly, injured and disabled living in their seven service communities.
                *They are made up of a volunteer staff of 150+ people, and a paid staff of only three (a
                cook, a kitchen assistant and a director of operations).
                *For more information, visit the Mobile Meals website at
                www.mobilemealsofwestfield.org or call 908-233-6146.
                Morgan writes, “I am a volunteer driver and now the volunteer coordinator for Mobile Meals of
                Westfield. This organization has had a profound impact on my ability to give back to my
                community. The genuine appreciation and gratitude our clients have for the services we
                provide, in not only meals but also in conversation and daily contact is invaluable. I think Mobile
                Meals is a good candidate for this award because of the widespread impact this has on our
                communities that we serve.” Congratulations to this organization!

                Andre Williams of Newark was nominated by his friend Keith Short. They worked together at
                UPS for years. Keith writes about his good friend&#39;s dedication to helping anyone in need. As a

                willingness to go beyond for anyone in need on a daily basis. Andre also shared with Chasing
                Good that he wanted to teach his son valuable life lessons about those in need when he was a
                young boy. To this day, he keeps pairs of shoes in his car just in case he should see someone in
                need. For these reasons, he captured our third place award for $500!

                making walking very difficult. This past fall, our house flooded during Hurricane Ida. In addition
                to the damage to our home, we lost our cars and my mobility equipment. Losing my scooters
                was a big problem because I could not get around. When Pauline found out I lost my scooters in
                the flood, she was on a mission to get me a new scooter. Pauline organized and coordinated

                losing my scooters, my friends surprised me with a new scooter. This was truly amazing. That
                moment, with this new scooter, my friends gave me a little independence back.”

                at the Cranford Public Library. She explains, “Liz DiLuccio and her mother, Lucy Santiago, first 
                started volunteering for the book sales run by The Friends of the Cranford Public Library after 
                attending the June 2021 Children’s Sale.  In a short time one or the other could be seen sorting 
                and shelving books almost every day the Cranford Library was open. In the weeks before the book 
                sale both Liz and Lucy sorted and shelved books for many hours each day, as more and more books 
                were donated.  They expanded the shelving, created appropriate signs, and even added new categories.  
                Liz and Lucy were unfailingly cheerful and energetic during those weeks of preparation.  For all that 
                they did, I nominate them for the Chasing Good award.”
