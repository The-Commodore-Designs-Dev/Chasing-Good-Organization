            <p>First place, winning, $1000 is Joann Mehalick of Clark, nominated by her friend Bonnie Busler.
                Bonnie explains: that years ago, there were no local resources for her friend or her family, to
                take advantage of at that time to help with mental illness or to learn how the family could
                adjust. Joann discovered the existence of NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness;
                www.nami.org) There were no local chapters available. My friend and her family felt hopeless.
                Putting apprehension and fear aside, she dove in headfirst and created the current and only
                Union County chapter of NAMI and never looked back. In doing so, she was able to help
                hundreds of families navigate the much misunderstood mental illness dilemma for those with
                these diseases as well as their bewildered families. She initiated training programs and provided
                available resources. She initiated the family to family course in the county and taught it for 5
                years while providing instruction and materials for new volunteers to teach the program. She
                introduced police training education to deal with the mentally ill to help alleviate major
                confrontations and confusion for the mentally ill. She sought out and arranged for professionals
                to speak to families and those with mental illness. These programs are still being implemented
                throughout Union County. She has done this all on a volunteer basis for 30+ years! Joann’s
                determination and passion has been an inspiration to all who know her.
                Congratulations to Joann!

                Second place went to an organization- Mobile Meals of Westfield. They took home $750. Here is
                some information on the wonderful work they do.
                *They are a non-profit organization which provides nutritious and delicious prepared
                meals for those unable to provide meals for themselves.
                *Their mission is to serve our neighbors in need by preparing/delivering meals &amp;
                providing caring contact. Mobile Meals of Westfield is a voluntary, 501(c)3 non-profit program,
                and is available to residents of Clark, Cranford, Fanwood, Garwood, Mountainside, Scotch Plains,
                and Westfield New Jersey.
                
                *They have provided meals for those unable to prepare meals for themselves since
                1968.
                *In their first 50 years of operation, they have served over one million meals to the ill,
                elderly, injured and disabled living in their seven service communities.
                *They are made up of a volunteer staff of 150+ people, and a paid staff of only three (a
                cook, a kitchen assistant and a director of operations).
                *For more information, visit the Mobile Meals website at
                www.mobilemealsofwestfield.org or call 908-233-6146.
                Morgan writes, “I am a volunteer driver and now the volunteer coordinator for Mobile Meals of
                Westfield. This organization has had a profound impact on my ability to give back to my
                community. The genuine appreciation and gratitude our clients have for the services we
                provide, in not only meals but also in conversation and daily contact is invaluable. I think Mobile
                Meals is a good candidate for this award because of the widespread impact this has on our
                communities that we serve.” Congratulations to this organization!

                Andre Williams of Newark was nominated by his friend Keith Short. They worked together at
                UPS for years. Keith writes about his good friend&#39;s dedication to helping anyone in need. As a
                retired UPS worker for over 25 years he&#39;s continued to spend his time collecting clothes, coats
                or by filling up jars with change and giving to homeless people throughout the city. He has a
                willingness to go beyond for anyone in need on a daily basis. Andre also shared with Chasing
                Good that he wanted to teach his son valuable life lessons about those in need when he was a
                young boy. To this day, he keeps pairs of shoes in his car just in case he should see someone in
                need. For these reasons, he captured our third place award for $500!

            <p>       
                The next Honorable Mention goes to Pauline Papapietro of Cranford. Rachel Schwartz of
                Cranford nominated her and writes, “I have MS which has severely impacted my mobility
                making walking very difficult. This past fall, our house flooded during Hurricane Ida. In addition
                to the damage to our home, we lost our cars and my mobility equipment. Losing my scooters
                was a big problem because I could not get around. When Pauline found out I lost my scooters in
                the flood, she was on a mission to get me a new scooter. Pauline organized and coordinated
                
                with a group of wonderful friends to buy me a new one. On September 8th, one week after
                losing my scooters, my friends surprised me with a new scooter. This was truly amazing. That
                moment, with this new scooter, my friends gave me a little independence back.”

                And finally, Liz DiLuccio and Lucy Santiago took home our last Honorable Mention award. 
                Kathleen Cirillo of Cranford nominated this mother and daughter duo for their volunteer work 
                at the Cranford Public Library. She explains, “Liz DiLuccio and her mother, Lucy Santiago, first 
                started volunteering for the book sales run by The Friends of the Cranford Public Library after 
                attending the June 2021 Children’s Sale.  In a short time one or the other could be seen sorting 
                and shelving books almost every day the Cranford Library was open. In the weeks before the book 
                sale both Liz and Lucy sorted and shelved books for many hours each day, as more and more books 
                were donated.  They expanded the shelving, created appropriate signs, and even added new categories.  
                Liz and Lucy were unfailingly cheerful and energetic during those weeks of preparation.  For all that 
                they did, I nominate them for the Chasing Good award.”
