                    It all started when Barbara and Nick married and raised their three daughters in New Jersey. 
                    As the girls grew older they witnessed their parents perform countless good deeds and selfless 
                    acts of kindness. They can remember their mom, a teacher, offering to help a struggling family 
                    in the district and their dad bringing bread to a social service agency for years. They welcomed 
                    people into their home, played a huge role in the church, and always thought of others before 
                    themselves. From sponsoring children in third world countries, to cooking and serving at soup 
                    kitchens, to organizing gifts and holiday food for needy families, Barbara and Nick set an 
                    incredible example of lives well-lived. Their girls; Michele, Christine, Antonia and later Johannah 
                    learned the impact and importance of volunteerism, which would ignite a passion inside of them. 
                    The idea of doing good and helping others was eventually passed on to the next generation of nine 
                    grandchildren ranging in age from 13-25.

                    Barbara and Nick, their children, sons-in-law, and grandchildren have all witnessed love and kindness 
                    throughout the years and wanted to create an organization to showcase and celebrate kind deeds out in 
                    the world. Together as a family, we are proud to present the Chasing Good Award (s) as we find good in 
                    the world! The goal is to discover inspiring, kind stories and reward the winners…because the world could 
                    always use some extra good in it!
