                It all started when Barbara and Nick married and raised their three daughters, in New Jersey. As the girls grew older, they witnessed their parents perform countless good deeds and selfless acts of kindness. They can remember their mom, a teacher, offering to help out a struggling family in the district and their dad bringing bread and other donations to social service agencies for years. They welcomed people into their home, played a huge role in the church, and always thought of others before themselves. Their girls: Michele, Christine, Antonia, and later Johannah learned the impact and importance of volunteerism, which would ignite a passion inside of them. The idea of doing good and helping others was eventually passed on to the next generation of nine grandchildren ranging in age from 25-13.
